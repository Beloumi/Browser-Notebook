# Browser-Notebook
In-browser encrypted and locally stored notes.

Browser-Notebook encrypts your notes using the Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library with Scrypt and stores them locally in your browser. 
You can use the program directly in your browser without any download, installation or registration by calling https://eck.cologne/browser-notebook/en/notes.html or you can download the files and use them locally without web access. 

Thanks to the Pell Editor, you can format texts and insert links or images (embedded in base64).

You need to run at least: 
- SJCL: sjcl.js and sjcl_scrypt.js as extra file
- PELL: pell.css and pell.js
- Two css files (tools-format.css and drop-down.css, that can be downloaded from the home page in the offline version)
